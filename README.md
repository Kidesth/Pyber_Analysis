# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
#### Explain the purpose of the new analysis. 
The purpose of the new analysis using python skills and knowledge of pandas is to create a summary data frame and apply matplotlib and create a multiple-line graph to show how it looks like the image of the data ride s-sharing fare with different cities and a limit time frame date, weeks and months. Pyber summary Data frame provides an overview compression of PyBerâ€™s ride-sharing services in different types of cities grouped into three types rural, suburban and urban cities. 
## Results: 
 Using images from the summary Data Frame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. The summary demonstrates that group demand for Pyber among riders compared the three types of grouped cities between a limit date from January 1, 2019, to April 29, 2019. 
 the result looks like
 
 Total rides:Total rides in different groped cities with a given time we get in rural cities 125 number of rides, in suburban cities 625 number of rides and in urban cities 1625.

 Total drivers: the total drivers in rural cities 78, the total number of drivers in suburban city 490 and the total number of drivers in urban cities 2045.

 Total Fares: the total fare amount in rural cities $4,327.93, the total fare amount in suburban cities $19,356.33 and the total fare amount of the urban cities $39,854.38.

 Total average fares per ride: the total averge fare per ride is in rural cities 34.62, the total number of average fare per ride in suburban cities 30.97 and the total number of average fare per ride in urban cities 24.52.

## Summary :
Based on the analysis the data of rural cities shows the avarage fare per ride and the avarage fare per driver much bigger than other to comparing cities and the total number ride and total number of driver is more less for the other comparing cities. this implicates the rural cities drivers get more  tipes. my recomandations PyBer ride-share businesses increasing the fare amount per drivres in Rural cities to full fill the riding  demand and increas number of drivers.
