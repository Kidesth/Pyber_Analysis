# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
#### Explain the purpose of the new analysis. 
The purpose of the new analysis using python skills and knowledge of pandas is to create a summary data frame and apply matplotlib and create a multiple-line graph to show how it looks like the image of the data ride s-sharing fare with different cities and a limit time frame date, weeks and months. Pyber summary Data frame provides an overview compression of PyBer’s ride-sharing services in different types of cities grouped into three types rural, suburban and urban cities. 
## Results: 
 Using images from the summary Data Frame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. The summary demonstrates that group demand for Pyber among riders compared the three types of grouped cities between a limit date from January 1, 2019, to April 29, 2019. 
 the result looks like
 
 Total rides:Total rides in different groped cities with a given time we get in rural cities 125 number of rides, in suburban cities 625 number of rides and in urban cities 1625.
